const img = new Image(); // used to load image from <input> and draw to canvas

// Fires whenever the img object loads a new image (such as with img.src =)
img.addEventListener('load', () => {
  // TODO

  // Some helpful tips:
  // - Fill the whole Canvas with black first to add borders on non-square images, then draw on top
  // - Clear the form when a new image is selected
  // - If you draw the image to canvas here, it will update as soon as a new image is selected
});
